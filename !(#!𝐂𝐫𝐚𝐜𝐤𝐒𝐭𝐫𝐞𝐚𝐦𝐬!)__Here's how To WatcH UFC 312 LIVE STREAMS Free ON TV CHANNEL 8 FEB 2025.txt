Looking for
Jubli will be part of the early prelims where he will take on Quillan Salkilld in the lightweight bout. The 35-year-old Indian MMA star will enter the ring after 470 days following his debut loss against Mike Breeden in October 2023.

Jubli has been struggling with a recurring knee injury but believes that he has had a perfect training camp ahead of the fight against Sailkilld who's unbeaten so far.

"Obviously it has been a while since my last fight, but I’ve not stopped training. My grind and hard work never stopped, and I was able to hit the gym and recover after getting my knee fixed. My body and mind are fresh, and I’m pretty confident ahead of the fight," told Anshul to Sportstar.

“MMA is a demanding sport, both physically and mentally. Injuries are part and parcel of it. Apart from the knee issue, I’ve had breathing issues as well, but I managed somehow. But now, with the problems set aside, I hope I can show the fearless version of me when I fight Salkilld,” he added. dfsdf fgg sdf
