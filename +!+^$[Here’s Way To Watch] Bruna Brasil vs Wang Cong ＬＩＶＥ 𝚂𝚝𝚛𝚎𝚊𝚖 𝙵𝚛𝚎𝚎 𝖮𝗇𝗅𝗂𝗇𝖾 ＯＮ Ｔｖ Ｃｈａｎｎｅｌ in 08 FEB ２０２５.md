WATCH: UFC 312: Dricus du Plessis vs. Sean Strickland 2 on ESPN+

du Plessis (22-2) beat Strickland (29-6) via split decision at UFC 297 last January to win the UFC middleweight title. Media members, fight fans, and the judges all had different scorecards. Strickland outlanded du Plessis in significant strikes, but the latter landed six takedowns. 

The Welkom, South Africa-born du Plessis submitted former champion Israel Adesanya in his last fight. He hopes to bring that aggressive nature into the Strickland rematch. 

"For me, the split decision was the biggest shock to me," Du Plessis said via MMA Junkie. "I didn’t think it was a split decision. … I am very happy that they made this fight. I was asking for this fight up until the Khamzat (Chimaev) win (over Robert Whittaker) happened, and then I would’ve preferred that fight, but I’m really happy this fight’s happening because now I can go and say, 'What are you going to say?'

"I’m going to put this to bed. All the stupid fans who believe he won that fight, I can just go out and put this behind me."

Strickland is 4-1 in his last five fights, beating Paulo Costa in June to return to being the top contender. The controversial fighter is close to holding top striking records at middleweight. He has credited du Plessis for his durability, but is ready to step it up and bring it to the champion in the rematch. 

"Me and Dricus have been thinking about this since we fought, before we fought," Strickland told ESPN’s Brett Okamoto via NY Fights. "It is gonna be f------ war. He wants it. I want it. I’m confident, he’s confident. But I think I’m gonna piece him apart."
