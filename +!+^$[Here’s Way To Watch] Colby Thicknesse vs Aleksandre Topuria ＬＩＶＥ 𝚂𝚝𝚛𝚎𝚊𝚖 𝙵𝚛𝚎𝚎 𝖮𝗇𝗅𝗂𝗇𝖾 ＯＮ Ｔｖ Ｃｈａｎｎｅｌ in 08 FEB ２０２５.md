UFC 312 info
Date: Feb. 8
Location: Qudos Bank Arena -- Sydney, Australia
Start time: 10 p.m. ET (Main card) 
How to watch: ESPN+ PPV

The pair of middleweights battled it out 13 months ago in a Fight of the Night effort that saw du Plessis take the title by split decision. The South African followed that up with a surprising submission of former champion Israel Adesanya. Du Plessis is 8-0 inside the Octagon with each performance standing out more and more. Strickland earned his chance at a rematch with a thorough win over Paulo Costa. 

The co-main event might be as dramatic when Zhang and Suarez meet. Zhang has not been super active of late with just four fights since June 2022. Her last win came in April when she battled past fellow Chinese fighter Yan Xiaonan. Suarez, meanwhile, has had her own problems with inactivity because of injuries throughout her career. Her last fight came in August 2023 when she submitted former champion Jessica Andrade.

While there's not a ton of meaningful fights to divisional rankings on the undercard, there are plenty of interesting names to the Oceanic region in action. Jake Matthews looks to get back on track when he takes on Francisco Prado to open the PPV. Matthews has alternated wins and losses in his last seven appearances. Then, another favored son is back when Jimmy Crute steps back into the Octagon to take on Rodolfo Bellato. Crute is winless in his last four appearances in the Octagon with three stoppage losses. And heavyweights get fans ready for the two title fights when Justin Tafa faces Tallison Teixeira. Tafa suffered his first defeat since 2021 in his last fight when he dropped a decision to Karl Williams. Before that, Tafa had ripped off three straight wins by KO.

One notable prelim fight sees the debut of Aleksandre Topuria, who is the older brother of featherweight champion Ilia Topuria. Aleksandre helped his brother become champion while putting his own career on hold. Now, he gets the chance to showcase his skills in a bantamweight showdown with Colby Thicknesse.

"I don't feel any pressure as a fighter," Aleksandre insisted. "You know when I feel pressure? I feel pressure when I have to stay with Ilia and show Ilia the correct things to do inside the cage. 

"Coaching a guy fighting Volkanovski for the world title and defending the title against Max Holloway. Let's not forget other guys like Josh Emmett or Bryce Mitchell... There was a lot of responsibility. So I felt pressure at that moment."
